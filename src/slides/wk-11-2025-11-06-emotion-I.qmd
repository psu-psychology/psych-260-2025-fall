- What causes emotion?
- What functions do emotions serve?

## What is emotion?

>The concept of ‘‘emotion’’ presents a particularly thorny problem.
Even though the term is used very frequently, to the point of being
extremely fashionable these days, the question ‘‘What is an emotion?’’ rarely generates the same answer from different individuals,
scientists or laymen alike.

## Components of emotion

- Cognitive appraisal
- Bodily (physiological) symptoms
- Motivation (action tendencies)
- Action 
- Subjective feelings

## What causes emotion?

>Do we run from a bear because we are afraid or are we afraid because we run? William James posed this question more than a century ago, yet the notion that afferent visceral signals are essential for the unique experiences of distinct emotions remains a key unresolved question at the heart of emotional neuroscience.

## Physiological states

>...**there is no 1-to-1 mapping between an emotion category and a specific autonomic nervous system response pattern**. In addition, we observed substantial variability in autonomic nervous system changes during instances of the same emotion category that was not accounted for by experimental moderators (such as the way the emotion was induced). 

-- @Siegel2018-ab

## Physiological states

>These findings suggest that **autonomic nervous system changes during emotion are less like a bodily fingerprint and more like a population of variable, context sensitive instances**.

## *Where* do emotions arise?

- If emotions are *localized*, what are the locations?

![@Lindquist2012-jr Figure 1. Fear: amygdala (yellow); Disgust: insula (green); Anger: OFC (rust); Sadness: ACC (blue)](https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170929031912583-0602:S0140525X11000446:S0140525X11000446_fig1g.jpeg)

## *Where* do emotions arise?

- If emotions are localized, is activity emotion-specific?

![@Lindquist2012-jr Figure 1.](https://static.cambridge.org/binary/version/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170929031912583-0602:S0140525X11000446:S0140525X11000446_fig6g.jpeg)

## *Where* do emotions arise?

>A psychological **constructionist account** of emotion assumes that **emotions are psychological events that emerge out of more basic psychological operations that are not specific to emotion**.

--- @Lindquist2012-jr

## *Where* do emotions arise?

>...**mental categories such as anger, sadness, fear, et cetera, are not respected by the brain**...

--- @Lindquist2012-jr

## *Where* do emotions arise?

> ...**emotions emerge when people make meaning out of sensory input from the body and from the world** using knowledge of prior experiences. Emotions are “situated conceptualizations” (cf. Barsalou 2003) because the emerging meaning is tailored to the immediate environment and prepares the person to respond to sensory input in a way that is tailored to the situation.

--- @Lindquist2012-jr

## Interim summary

- Emotion consists of multiple components, including cognition & action tendencies
- Emotions have distinguishable patterns of subjective feelings, external actions
- Emotions do not have distinct ANS response patterns
- Emotions do not have distinct brain activation patterns
- Can't be easily *localized* in the CNS

  - discovered 'rewarding' power of electrical self-stimulation
- Heath [-@heath1963electrical] studied effects in human patients.

## Implications

- Specific circuits signal pleasure

## Exogenous substances

- Modulate endogenous neurotransmitter systems in some cases
- Influence subjective feelings of pain, pleasure
- Vary in relative health risk

## Comparative risk

>A comparative risk assessment of drugs including alcohol and tobacco using the margin of exposure (MOE) approach was conducted. The MOE is defined as ratio between toxicological threshold (benchmark dose) and estimated human intake. Median lethal dose values from animal experiments were used to derive the benchmark dose. The human intake was calculated for individual scenarios and population-based scenarios...

-- @Lachenmeier2015-mm

## Comparative risk

>...For individual exposure the four substances alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and heroin fall into the “high risk” category with MOE < 10, the rest of the compounds except THC fall into the “risk” category with MOE < 100.

-- @Lachenmeier2015-mm

## Comparative risk

>The toxicological MOE approach validates epidemiological and social science-based drug ranking approaches especially in regard to the positions of alcohol and tobacco (high risk) and cannabis (low risk).

-- @Lachenmeier2015-mm

## Interim summary

- Types of pleasure activate overlapping areas
- Pleasure/happiness engage distributed brain network
    - VTA and ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens especially important
    
## Interim summary

- Pleasure/happiness signaling involves multiple NTs
  - DA especially important in signalling unexpected outcomes
- “Reward” pathways activated multiple inputs
- Some *exogenous* substances associated with feelings of pleasure or relief from pain bind to *endogenous* receptor systems

# Wrap up

## Main points

- *Feelings* only one part of emotion
- Emotion circuits in the CNS widely distributed, interconnected
- Emotion circuits involve multiple NTs
