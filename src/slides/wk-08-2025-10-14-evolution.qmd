## Today's topics

- Quiz 2
- Evolution of the nervous system

# Evolution of the nervous system

## Principles of evolution

::: {.incremental}
- Life on Earth has existed for ~3.5 billion years
- Life forms existing in the Earth's past differed from those living today
- New generations of life forms inherit properties from their predecessors
:::

## Principles of evolution

::: {.incremental}
- New life forms evolved as a result of *mutations*, *selection pressures*, and *geological events*
- Greater reproductive success (more offspring) for some individuals, not others
- Characteristics of those who have more offspring increase in relative frequency in the population
:::

## Evidence for evolution

- Fossil
  + Fossil dating (radiometric)
- Geological
  + Where fossils are found relative to one another (relative dating)
  + How long it takes to form layers
    
## Evidence for evolution

- Chemical
  + Similarities between vastly different species (e.g., in neurotransmitters, hormones, receptors, metabolic pathways, etc.) 
- Genetic
  + Rates of mutation
  + Developmental patterns of gene expression
    
## Evidence for evolution

- Anatomical

>Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution

>Seen in the light of evolution, biology is, perhaps, intellectually the most satisfying and inspiring science. Without that light, it becomes a pile of sundry facts some of them interesting or curious, but making no meaningful picture as a whole.

## Cambrian Explosion

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtQwUO9ff8 height="70%" width="100%" >}}

-- @The-Economist2015-gl

## Cambrian Explosion

- Complex multicellular lifeforms emerged ~541 million years ago
- "Explosion" in geological terms: lasted ~13-25 million years

## Did *behavior* spark the explosion? [@fox_what_2016]

- Behavior requires movement through space
- Behavior requires perception at a distance
- Behavior requires coordinating perception with action

## Did *behavior* spark the explosion? [@fox_what_2016]

- Behavior requires fast & specific communication systems
- Behavior requires **energy**

## Requirements of behavior

- Input
  - From external world
  - Internal states
- Processing
- Output
  - Move body
  - Change physiological state

## How nervous systems differ...

- Body symmetry
  + radial
  + bilateral
- Segmentation
- Centralized vs. distributed function

## How nervous systems differ

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- Cephalization: sense organs & nervous system concentrated in anterior
- Encasement in bone (vertebrates)

::::

## Nervous systems are similar...

- in patterns of early nervous system development 
  - across vastly different species
  - with very distant (in time) common ancestors
- Why?
  - Later forms evolved from earlier ones
  - Limited number of ways to build nervous systems that work well

## Vertebrates have similar brain plans

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- Species differ in relative size of parts

## Vertebrate brain sizes scale with body

![@Northcutt2002-jg](../include/img/northcutt-2002-f2.gif)

## Some vertebrates have bigger brains than others

![Jerison from brainmuseum.org](https://brainmuseum.org/evolution/paleo/images/brnbodwt4.gif)

## Some vertebrates have bigger brains than others

- Mammals and birds have big brains
- Some specific mammals and birds have big brains for their bodies
    + Humans
    + Crows
    + Porpoises
- Bigger than expected brains (relative to average) = high 'encephalization factor'

## Cerebral cortex size differs among mammals

![@hofman_evolution_2014](http://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/78485/fnana-08-00015-HTML/image_m/fnana-08-00015-g001.jpg)

## Primates have large cerebral cortex

| Structural measure | Non-human comparison | Human |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Cortical gray matter %/tot brain vol | insectivores 25% | 50% |
| Cortical gray + white | mice 40% | 80% |
| Cerebellar mass | primates, mammals 10-15% | 10-15% |

## Primates have large cerebral cortex

![@Rakic2009-jk](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrn2719/MediaObjects/41583_2009_Article_BFnrn2719_Fig1_HTML.jpg?as=webp)

## Selection pressures shaping brain evolution

- Natural and sexual selection for
    + Traits that improve reproductive success
- Physical AND psychological traits
    + Hardware and software

## Virtues of big brains
  
- More memory
- More & faster processing capacity
- Better sensors
- Better output
- Do more, faster

## Costs of bigness

- Long time to build
- Long time to program/train/educate
- Lots of energy to nourish/maintain
- Head/neck must be strong enough to carry
  - How to connect brain/body parts widely, but process info quickly

## A new view [@Herculano-Houzel2016-oy]

- **Number** of neurons in *cerebral cortex* makes humans "special", not overall mass

## How did the human brain get this way?

- Evolved from mammalian/primate norms
- More efficient energy intake
  + calories/hr foraging vs.
  + cooking? [@Wrangham2009-vq]
    
## How did the human brain get this way?

- Specialized patterns of development
  + Significant time post-natal/pre-reproductive (childhood)
  + Central role of language & culture
    
# Wrap-up
