## Study suggestions

- Identify key *vocabulary* and *ideas*
- Look away from the slides or book
- Quiz yourself (or work with others)
  - Who's Descartes? What did he do/think?
  - Spatial resolution means...
- Look at a figure, explain what it is/means
- Spend ~2-3 hours outside of class for every hour in class

# Wrap-up on structural methods

## Take homes

- Functional methods differ in
  - Spatial resolution
  - Temporal resolution
  - What's measured
  - Invasiveness
  - Cost
- Which one is best? Depends on your question. 

## Next time

- Cells of the nervous system
- Neuroanatomy
