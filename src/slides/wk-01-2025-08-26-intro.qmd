## What is this course about? {-}

- What is behavior?
- How is human behavior similar to/different from other animals?
- What are the *neurological* bases (of human) behavior?
- What *other* bases (of human behavior) are there?
- How do the neurological bases of human behavior affect your life?

- Why does taking/drinking X make me feel Y?
- My grandmother has Alzheimer's disease. What's happening to her brain?
- Carrie Fisher had bipolar disorder. What's that about?
- Why is sleep so important for brain health?
- My mom says my frontal cortex isn't fully mature. Is she right?

## There are many "neurological" bases...

## Keys for success {-}

- Study the figures, not just the text.
- Study regularly -- don't cram.
- Come to class.
- Participate!

## Why is biology essential for the science of behavior? {-}

- What is science?
    - What distinguishes sciences?
    - What is neuroscience?
- Why is neuroscience harder than physics?

## What is [science](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/science)? {-}

- Body of facts or truths
- Process of acquiring knowledge
    - Systematic study
    - Observation, experiment, description
    - Aims at reliable, reproducible, general, systematic, universal laws
    - *Strives* for objectivity
 
## Science vs. other ways of thinking {-}

- Science is a *way of thinking* and a *set of behaviors*
- Scientists strive toward *communal norms* [@Merton1979-le]: communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, organized skepticism.
- Science *describes*, tries to *predict*

## Science alone...

- Not well-suited to *prescribing* (recommending) or *proscribing* (prohibiting)
    - little to say about what is good, just, right, moral, etc.
    - (Although systematic descriptions of phenomena can be used to make pre/proscriptive claims...)
    
## Science rests on **evidence and logic** 
    
- <span class="blue">NOT on authorities</span> (e.g., people whose stature is largely or solely based on their position or economic status)
- However, some scientific claims (and scientists) are more credible and authoritative than others.
- Everyone has opinions. Are yours supported by *evidence*?
    
## Science respects tradition
    
- but not uncritically
  - questions and tests it repeatedly...
  
## Science should be...

- reproducible, robust, transparent
  - others can get the same answer if they follow the same procedures
- but see [PSYCH 490.003](https://psu-psychology.github.io/psych-490-reproducibility-2023-spring)

## Science...

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
- has led to huge advances in human health & prosperity
- We *all* pay for scientific research, substantially through tax-payer support of government agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [@Unknown2022-fu]

## Gilmore's opinion:

+ Science will be essential for maintaining & extending these advances in the future Federal funding agencies [@Unknown2022-fu]
    
## Similarities among sciences {-}

- What are the different kinds of X?
    - **Form**, e.g., anatomy
- How does X work?
    - **Function**, e.g., physiology
- Where did X come from?
    - **Origins**, e.g., development/evolution
    
## Examples {-}

- "Coronavirus gets its name because of its crown-like shape."
- "Viruses reproduce (and cause illness) by forcing host organisms to create massive quantities of the virus that then spread to others."
- "Coronavirus appears to have originated in non-human animals in China."

## We are family

## Differences among sciences {-}

- Phenomena of interest (studying *what*)
- Methods or tools (studying it *how*)
- At what *level(s) of analysis*
    - Spatial scale (nanometers $10^{-9}m$ to light-years $10^{15}m$)
    - Temporal scale (milliseconds $10^{-3}s$ to millenia $10^3s$)
    
## What is neuroscience? {-}

- The study of the nervous system
    - And the behavior it makes possible
- Questions neuroscience asks...
    - What are the parts of the nervous system?
    - How do the parts work?  What do they do?
    - Where did they come from?

## Spatial and temporal scales in neuroscience {-}
