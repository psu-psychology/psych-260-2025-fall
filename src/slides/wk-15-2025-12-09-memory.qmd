>"Entirety of a human's lived experience could fit on a flash drive."

## Computer memory

::: {.incremental}
- Random Access Memory (RAM), short-duration storage
- Hard-disk/flash drive storage, long-term duration
- Addressable (location '010101')
- {text, sounds, images, video, data} all in binary [0,1] format
    - `00110000` == 48 (the number)
    - `00110000` == '0' (the character zero)
- Write once, read many times

:::

## Computers vs. brains

::: {.incremental}
- Computers have separate memory hardware
    - *brains store info everywhere*
- Computers have addressable memory
    - *brain memory??*
- Computer memory can be non-volatile
    - *brain memories fade*
- Computer memory is veridical
    - *brain memories are 'reconstructions'*

:::

# Biological bases of memory

## Types

::: {.incremental}
- *Short-term* vs. *long-term*
    - *Working memory* ~ short-term information maintenance for guiding action
- *Explicit* (declarative: semantic vs. episodic; 'knowing that') vs. *implicit* (procedural or 'knowing how')

:::

## Types

::: {.incremental}
- *Retrospective* (from the past) vs. *prospective* (to be remembered)
- How tested or revealed? 
  - *Recognition* vs.
  - *Recall*:

:::

## A taxonomy

![@squire_memory_2004](../include/img/squire-memory-systems.gif)

## Mechanism(s)

::: {.fragment}

>The idea that memory is stored as enduring changes in the brain dates back at least to the time of Plato and Aristotle (circa 350 BCE), but its scientific articulation emerged in the 20th century when Richard Semon introduced the term **“engram” to describe the neural substrate for storing and recalling memories**. 

-- @Josselyn2020-xr

:::

## Mechanism(s)

>Essentially, Semon proposed that **an experience activates a population of neurons that undergo persistent chemical and/or physical changes to become an engram**. Subsequent reactivation of the engram by cues available at the time of the experience induces memory retrieval. 

-- @Josselyn2020-xr

## Neural substrates (engrams) consist of

- Changes in *patterns of neural activity*
- Changes in *connectivity*
    + New synapses
    + Altered synapses (strengthened or weakened)

## Hebbian learning

>"*When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficacy, as on of the cells firing B, is increased.*" 

-- @Hebb1949-se

## Hebbian learning

>"*Neurons that fire together wire together.*"

-- @Lowel1992-lk

## Hebbian learning is *associative*

- Neuron A active & 
- Neuron B active $\rightarrow$

<!-- ## How does LTP (& Long-term depression or LTD) work? -->

<!-- - Synapses can also be weakened via long-term depression (LTD) -->
<!-- - NMDA receptor one molecular mechanism for implementing LTP, LTD & spike-timing-dependent plasticity -->
<!-- - Ca++ entry triggers biochemical cascade -->

<!-- ## How does LTP (& Long-term depression or LTD) work? -->

<!-- - Existing (AMPA) glutamate receptors made to stay open longer -->
<!-- - New AMPA glutamate receptors synthesized, inserted into postsynaptic membrane -->
<!-- - Change in quantity of glutamate released presynaptically -->

>*Every day is alone in itself, whatever enjoyment I’ve had, and whatever sorrow I’ve had…Right now, I’m wondering, have I done or said anything amiss?  You see at this moment, everything looks clear to me, but what happened just before?  That’s what worries me.  It’s like waking from a dream.  I just don’t remember.*

-- HM

## Other causes of amnesia
