::: {.column width=50%}
- **Non-associative**
    - Change in response to repeated encounters with same stimulus/event
    - Habituation -> weaker response

::::
:::

## Computer memory

::: {.incremental}
- Random Access Memory (RAM), short-duration storage
- Hard-disk/flash drive storage, long-term duration
- Addressable (location '010101')
- {text, sounds, images, video, data} all in binary [0,1] format
    - `00110000` == 48 (the number)
    - `00110000` == '0' (the character zero)
- Write once, read many times

:::

## Brain memory

::: {.incremental}
- Computers have separate memory hardware
    - brains store info everywhere
- Computers have addressable memory
    - brain memory??
- Computer memory can be non-volatile
    - brain memories fade
- Computer memory is veridical
    - brain memories are 'reconstructions'

:::

# Biological bases of memory

## Types

::: {.incremental}
- Short vs. long-term
    - Working memory ~ short-term information maintenance for guiding action
- Explicit (declarative: semantic vs. episodic) vs. implicit (procedural)
- Retrospective (from the past) vs. prospective (to be remembered)
- Recognition (familiar or novel) vs. recall

:::

## Mechanism(s)

>The idea that memory is stored as enduring changes in the brain dates back at least to the time of Plato and Aristotle (circa 350 BCE), but its scientific articulation emerged in the 20th century when Richard Semon introduced the term **“engram” to describe the neural substrate for storing and recalling memories**. 

-- @Josselyn2020-xr

## Mechanism(s)

>Essentially, Semon proposed that **an experience activates a population of neurons that undergo persistent chemical and/or physical changes to become an engram**. Subsequent reactivation of the engram by cues available at the time of the experience induces memory retrieval. 

-- @Josselyn2020-xr

## Mechanism(s)

- Changes in patterns of neural activity
- Changes in connectivity
    + New synapses
    + Altered synapses (strengthened or weakened)

## Hebbian learning

>"*When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficacy, as on of the cells firing B, is increased.*" 

-- @Hebb1949-se

::: {.fragment}

>"*Neurons that fire together wire together.*"

## Implementing 'Hebbian' learning

<!-- ## How does LTP (& Long-term depression or LTD) work? -->

<!-- - Synapses can also be weakened via long-term depression (LTD) -->
<!-- - NMDA receptor one molecular mechanism for implementing LTP, LTD & spike-timing-dependent plasticity -->
<!-- - Ca++ entry triggers biochemical cascade -->

<!-- ## How does LTP (& Long-term depression or LTD) work? -->

<!-- - Existing (AMPA) glutamate receptors made to stay open longer -->
<!-- - New AMPA glutamate receptors synthesized, inserted into postsynaptic membrane -->
<!-- - Change in quantity of glutamate released presynaptically -->

## NMDA-R clinical significance

- *Memantine* (Alzheimer's Disease treatment) *blocks* NMDA-R
    - Controls over-activation and $Ca^{++}$ excitotoxicity?
- Implicated in effects of *phencylidine* (PCP)
    - PCP can induce psychotic symptoms
    - Link to glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia

## NMDA-R clinical significance

- *Ketamine* is an NMDA-R antagonist
    - anesthesia, sedation, pain relief
    - short-term relief for depression
- Linked to analgesic (pain-relieving) effects of nitrous oxide ($N_{2}O$) or 'laughing' gas
- Ethanol inhibits [(Ron et al., 2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21204417)

## Summary

- Learning and memory involve changes in neural firing, circuitry
    - And probably molecular changes inside neurons
- Hebbian learning a type of associative learning
- NMDA receptor as coincidence detector
    + Molecular basis of one form of long-term potentiation (LTP)
- Unlike computers, brains store different types of information stored in different brain systems

# Disorders of memory

## Amnesia

- Acquired loss of memory
- ≠ normal forgetting
- Note: computers don't forget

- *Retrograde* ('backwards' in time)
    + Damage to information acquired pre-injury
    + Temporally graded
- *Anterograde* ('forward' in time) 
    + Damage to information acquired/experienced post-injury

## [Patient HM](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/corkin-hm-memory.html) (Henry G. Molaison)

- Intractable/untreatable epilepsy
- Bilateral resection of medial temporal lobe (1953)
- Epilepsy now treatable
- But, memory impaired
- Lived until 2008

<!-- Brenda Milner on HM -->

- Retrograde amnesia
    + Can’t remember 10 yrs before operation
    + Distant past better than more recent
- Severe, global anterograde amnesia
    + Impaired learning of new facts, events, people
- But, skills (mirror learning) intact
    
>*Every day is alone in itself, whatever enjoyment I’ve had, and whatever sorrow I’ve had…Right now, I’m wondering, have I done or said anything amiss?  You see at this moment, everything looks clear to me, but what happened just before?  That’s what worries me.  It’s like waking from a dream.  I just don’t remember.*

#### Other causes of amnesia

- Disease 
    + Alzheimer’s, herpes virus
- [Korsakoff’s syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korsakoff%27s_syndrome)
