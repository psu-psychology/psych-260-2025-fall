# Careers in neuroscience

## Job prospects

>"*Employment in healthcare occupations is projected to grow 15 percent from 2019 to 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations, adding about 2.4 million new jobs. Healthcare occupations are projected to add more jobs than any of the other occupational groups. This projected growth is mainly due to an aging population, leading to greater demand for healthcare services.*"

[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home.htm#:~:text=Employment%20in%20healthcare%20occupations%20is,of%20the%20other%20occupational%20groups.)
