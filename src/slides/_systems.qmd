## Your turn

Think of a system you know something about.

What makes it a system?

## Systems have... {-}

- Boundaries
- Components
- Interactions
- Forces/influences
- Inputs, outputs, processes

## Systems...

- "Behave" or change state across time
- May (or may not) return to starting state
- Appear to be regulated, controlled, influenced by feedback loops

## May be thought of as [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science) {-}

## Why is studying systems so hard? {-}

- Single parts -> multiple functions
- Single functions -> multiple parts
- Change structure/function over time (learning, development, evolution) == are *dynamic*

## Why is studying systems so hard? {-}

- Naturally occurring systems not "designed" like human-engineered ones
- What is being exchanged/processed? 
    - Answer (often): Information
- What is being controlled?
- *Stochastic* not *deterministic*

## Extra credit assignment {-}

::: {.callout-important}

Take your own example system from earlier.
What are the *components* of that system?
What are the *inputs and outputs*?
What do the components *exchange*?

**Send a 1 page write-up describing your system and answers to these questions to Katie via Canvas by Friday, September 5 at 5:00 PM for 2 extra credit points.**
