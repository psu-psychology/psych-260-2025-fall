## Spatial and Temporal Resolution {- #spatial-temporal-resolution}

## Your turn

- What's a micro (spatially small) influence on/aspect of behavior or mental experience?
- What's a macro (spatially large)...
- What's a micro (temporally short)...
- What's a macro (temporally long)...

## Why does this matter?

- Different phenomena, -> levels of resolution
- Different resolution -> different methods
- How does the micro affect macro or vice versa?
- What's cause and what's effect?

### Skill-building

Being able to think about spatial and temporal levels of analysis inside and outside of neuroscience is extremely useful.

Example: How does *your* personal spending affect the global economy?

## Spatial Resolution in Detail {-}

- Within an individual
    + molecular
        * genetic
        * receptor
    + chemical
        * neurotransmitter/hormonal
    + cellular
        * neuronal firing
        
---

- Internal to individuals
    + network
        * lateral inhibition
    + area
        * V1 varies by ~2x
    + region
        * Wiring/connectivity differences
    + system
    
---

- External to individuals
    + Social
        * Friends, family, teachers, others
    + Non-social
        * Neighborhood, school, state/region, country
        * Physical environment

## Temporal Resolution in Detail {-}

- Within one lifetime
    + Microseconds
        * detection position from acoustic stimulation
    + Milliseconds
        * action potential
    + Seconds
        * changes in EEG power
        * short-term memory

---

- Within one lifetime
    + Minutes
        * synaptic plasticity
    + Hours
        * memory consolidation
        * Hormone (melatonin, cortisol) levels
    + Days

---

- Within one lifetime
    + Weeks
    + Months
    + Years
        * education & training
        * disease processes
        * cultural change
        
---

- Across lifetimes
    + Centuries
        * cultural changes
    + Millenia
        * Natural & sexual selection
