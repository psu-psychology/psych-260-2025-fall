### Principles of evolution {-}

- Life forms existing in the Earth's past differed from those living today
- New generations of life forms inherit properties from their predecessors
- New life forms evolved as a result of *mutations*, *selection pressures*, and *geological events* 
- Greater reproductive success (more offspring) for some, not others

### Evidence for evolution {-}

- Fossil
    + Fossil dating (radiometric)
- Geological
    + Where fossils are found relative to one another (relative dating)
    + How long it takes to form layers
- Molecular
    + Similarities between vastly different species (e.g., in neurotransmitters, receptors, metabolic pathways, etc.) 
- Genetic
    + Rates of mutation
    + Developmental patterns of gene expression
- Anatomical

Dobzhansky, T. (1973). Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. *The American Biology Teacher*, *35*(3), 125–129. https://doi.org/10.2307/4444260

> *"Seen in the light of evolution, biology is, perhaps, intellectually the most satisfying and inspiring science. Without that light, it becomes a pile of sundry facts some of them interesting or curious, but making no meaningful picture as a whole."*

### Why Gilmore thinks evolution is controversial (in the U.S.) {-}

- Contradicts verbatim/non-metaphorical reading of some religious texts
- Makes humans seem less special
- Time scales involved beyond human experience
- Scientific method vs. other ways of knowing
- Found in nature ≠ good for human society
- Few negative consequences of 'disbelief'
- U.S. culture individualistic, skeptical of experts & [expertise](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZrSRpQg9L._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)
- Lower levels of religious belief among [U.S. scientists](http://news.rice.edu/2015/12/03/first-worldwide-survey-of-religion-and-science-no-not-all-scientists-are-atheists/)

The telescope is equipped with infrared-sensing instruments capable of detecting light that was emitted by the most ancient stars and galaxies. Essentially, the telescope allows scientists to see back in time roughly 13.5 billion years, near the beginning of the universe as we know it, Leja explained.*"

#### Cambrian Explosion {-}

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNtQwUO9ff8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Complex multicellular lifeforms emerged ~541 million years ago
- "Explosion" in geological terms: lasted ~13-25 million years

##### What sparked the explosion? [[@fox_what_2016]](http://doi.org/10.1038/530268a) {-}

- Behavior requires movement through space
- Behavior requires coordinating perception with action
- Behavior requires perception at a distance
- Behavior requires fast & specific communication systems
- Behavior requires **energy**

#### How nervous systems differ... {-}

- Body symmetry
    + radial
    + bilateral
- Segmentation
- Centralized vs. distributed function
- Cephalization: sense organs & nervous system concentrated in anterior
- Encasement in bone (vertebrates)

#### How nervous systems are similar... {-}

- Similarities in patterns of early nervous system development 
    - across vastly different species
    - with very distant (in time) common ancestors
    - limited number of ways to build nervous systems that successfully regulate behavior

- Brain size scales with body size (more or less)
- Mammals and birds have big brains
- Some animals have big brains for their bodies
    + Humans
    + Crows
    + Porpoises
- Bigger than expect brains (relative to average) = high 'encephalization factor'

#### A new view [@Herculano-Houzel2016-oy] {-}

- **Number** of neurons in *cerebral cortex* makes humans "special"

|---------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Human   | 16 B               | 1233              |

##### How did the human brain get this way? {-}

- Building upon mammalian/primate norms
- More efficient energy intake
    + calories/hr foraging vs.
    + cooking? [@Wrangham2009-vq].
- Specialized patterns of development
    + Significant time post-natal/pre-reproductive (childhood)
    + Central role of language & culture
    
### Take homes {-}

- Life forms on Earth have evolved over *billions* of years
- Complex multi-cellular organisms with nervous systems emerged ~500-600 *million* years ago
- Centralized nervous systems have similarities in organization
- Human brains similar to closely related species, but have more neurons in cerebral cortex
- Cerebral cortex in humans may have *developmental mechanisms* not found in other animals [@Vanderhaeghen2023-ay](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41583-023-00675-z).

>The brain of modern humans has evolved remarkable computational abilities that enable higher cognitive functions. These capacities are tightly linked to an increase in the size and connectivity of the cerebral cortex, which is thought to have resulted from evolutionary changes in the mechanisms of cortical development. Convergent progress in evolutionary genomics, developmental biology and neuroscience has recently enabled the identification of genomic changes that act as human-specific modifiers of cortical development. These modifiers influence most aspects of corticogenesis, from the timing and complexity of cortical neurogenesis to synaptogenesis and the assembly of cortical circuits. Mutations of human-specific genetic modifiers of corticogenesis have started to be linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, providing evidence for their physiological relevance and suggesting potential relationships between the evolution of the human brain and its sensitivity to specific diseases.

- Humans, on much more limited scale
  - hippocampus (especially dentate gyrus)
  - striatum
  - olfactory bulb (minimally)
  - not much, if any, in cerebral cortex
- Most neurogenesis occurs near ventricles

- Neonatal brain largely unmyelinated
- Gradual myelination, peaks <span color="red">in mid-20s</span>
- Non-uniform pattern
    - Spinal cord before brain
    - Sensory before motor

### Summary of developmental milestones {-}

#### Prenatal {-}

+ Neuro- and gliogenesis
+ Migration
+ Synaptogenesis begins
+ Differentiation
+ Apoptosis
+ Myelination begins

#### Postnatal {-}

+ Synaptogenesis
+ Cortical expansion, activity-dependent change
- Then cubic, quadratic, or linear declines in cortical thickness
+ Myelination
+ Prolonged period of postnatal/pre-reproductive development [[@konner_evolution_2011]](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674062016)
- Neurogenesis in selected areas (cerebellum; basal ganglia; hippocampus)
