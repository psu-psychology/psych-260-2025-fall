## Warm-up {-}

### Neuroscience is harder than physics because...{-}

- A. The brain has more parts than any other physical entity we know about.
- B. Physicists have largely ignored biology.
- C. Nervous systems are influenced by multiple factors we can't (yet) measure effectively.
- D. Physicists only study "toy" problems.

### Systems have all of the following components EXCEPT: {-}

- A. Boundaries
- B. Components
- C. Interactions among components
- D. Inputs and outputs
- E. Readily predictable behavior

## Why study history? {-}

- What can *observation* tell us about brain and behavior?
- Vital role of *tools/methods/techniques* in discovery
- *"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."* -- Isaac Newton, 1676

- Earliest evidence +7,000 yrs old

### Egyptians (1,500-3,000 BCE)  {-}

knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Alulu_Beer_Receipt.jpg")
```

- What does beer-making have to do with the neurological bases of human behavior?

### Greek and Roman era  {-}

- [*Hippocrates*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates)
    - Epilepsy a disease of the brain [[@Chudler_undated-lu]](http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/hist.html)
    - Brain set of intelligence [[@Chudler_undated-lu]](http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/hist.html)
- [*Aristotle* (~335 BCE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)
    - mind and body not distinct.
    - brain “cools” the body, *heart* is the mental organ.
    
```{r aristotle, fig.cap="http://classicalwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aristotle-face-1.jpg"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Galenus.jpg/220px-Galenus.jpg")
```

- Physician in Roman Empire, of Greek descent
- Anatomical reports based on dissection of monkeys, pigs
- Influenced by Hippocrates notion of human temperaments (~personalities) linked to "humors": blood, black bile, yellow bile, phlegm
- Observed that gladiators' head injuries impaired thinking, movement
- Speculated that fluid filling the brain cavities called *ventricles*, circulates through nerves, body == "ventricular" theory of nervous system function.

```

### What did early humans know about the mind and brain?  {-}

- Mental functions controlled by organs in the head, i.e., the brain
- Mental functions can be influenced by substances we consume
- Head injury can impair behavior and thinking
- Something flows from brain to body via nerves

### Why didn't they know more? {-}

- Limited technology.
- Limited cultural support for systematic observation & description. = **SCIENCE**
- Lack of ability to use knowledge even if it were acquired.

## The "dark" ages (in Europe, not elsewhere) {-}

- [Ibn al-Haytham's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen) *Optics*, ~1000 CE
- [Mansur's *Anatomy*](https://exhibitions.lib.cam.ac.uk/vesalius/artifacts/mansurs-anatomy/) ~1400 CE

## Renaissance and the Enlightenment: New technologies, new ideas  {-}

### *Leonardo da Vinci* (~1508) {-}

```{r davinci-ventricals-fig, fig.cap="[[@Penttila2019-wt]](https://dana.org/article/the-hidden-neuroscience-of-leonardo-da-vinci/)"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://dana.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Leonardo-2m-cerebral-ventricles-news-2019.jpg")
```

- Wax casts of ventricles
    - fluid filled inner regions of brain
- Ventricles not spherical!

### *Andreas Vesalius* (1543) {-}

- *De Humani Corporis Fabrica Libri Septem (On the fabric of the human body in seven books)* [[@vesalius-1543]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Humani_Corporis_Fabrica_Libri_Septem#Book_3:_The_Veins_and_Arteries,_Book_4:_The_Nerves)
- 1st detailed drawings of brain and body anatomy

```{r vesalius-fig, fig.cap="[[@vesalius-1543]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Humani_Corporis_Fabrica_Libri_Septem#Book_3:_The_Veins_and_Arteries,_Book_4:_The_Nerves)"}

```

### René Descartes -- mid 1600’s {-}

- Reflexes “reflect” sensory events in the world
- Not the same as voluntary functions

```{r descartes-reflex-fig, fig.cap="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Descartes-reflex.JPG"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Descartes-reflex.JPG")
```

- Reflexes and animal “minds” are physical, machine-like
- Human mind is not machine-like
    - “Dual” influences on behavior
    - Physical + spiritual
    - Descartes a *philosophical dualist*
- Soul controls body via *pineal gland*
    - Fluid from ventricles cause muscles to “inflate” (another ventricular theory)
    
::: {.infobox}

Descartes is an important figure for this class.

## Pineal gland  {-}

```{r fig-pineal, fig.cap="Figure of the pineal gland by Descartes: http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/descartes-pineal-gland-granger.jpg"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/descartes-pineal-gland-granger.jpg")
```

::: {.infobox}

**Do you agree with Descartes?**

- **Yes**, human minds are fundamentally different from animal minds. The human mind is influenced by both physical and extraphysical processes.
- **No**, human minds are similar to animal minds. The human mind arises solely from physical processes.

:::

**How would you _scientifically_ test Descartes idea about the role of the pineal gland?**

## Other milestones  {-}

- Invention of [light microscope](http://www.history-of-the-microscope.org/invention-of-glass-lenses-and-the-history-of-the-light-microscope.php) (1609 CE), [electron microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope) (1926)
- Cell stains -- [Camillo Golgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camillo_Golgi), [Santiago Ramon y Cajal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ram%C3%B3n_y_Cajal) -- late 1800s
- Recording of electrical activity of nerves, [Luigi Galvani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Galvani)
- [Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging)

## Some lessons from early history {-}

- Neuroscience shaped by new methods, tools
- If you can't see it/measure it, you can't say much about it
- Neuroscience shaped by [great debates](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/courses/1010/mangels/neugiro/history/history.html)
    - Is the mind == brain?
    - Are functions local or distributed?
    - Do neurons connect like pipes or pass info like relay runners?
- Forms & phenomena at multiple levels of analysis contribute to function
