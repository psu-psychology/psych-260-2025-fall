**Your turn**

- What's a micro (spatially small) influence on/aspect of behavior?
- What's a macro (spatially large)...
- What's a micro (temporally short)...
- What's a macro (temporally long)...

:::

## Why does this matter? {-}

- Different methods, different levels of analysis
- Challenge of linking phenomena across levels
    + How does the micro affect macro or vice versa?
- Challenge of interpretation

**Important skills**: Being able to think about spatial and temporal levels of analysis inside and outside of neuroscience.

## Spatial Resolution in Detail {-}

- Within an individual
    + molecular
        * genetic
        * receptor
    + chemical
        * neurotransmitter/hormonal
    + cellular
        * neuronal firing
- Internal to individuals
    + network
        * lateral inhibition
    + area
        * V1 varies by ~2x
    + region
        * Wiring/connectivity differences
    + system
- External to individuals
    + Social
        * Friends, family, teachers, others
    + Non-social
        * Neighborhood, school, state/region, country
        * Physical environment
