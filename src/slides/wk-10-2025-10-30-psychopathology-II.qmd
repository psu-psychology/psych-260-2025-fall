- Formerly “manic depression” or “manic depressive disorder"
- Alternating mood states
  + Mania or hypomania (milder form)
  + Depression

## Background on BPD

- 1-3% lifetime prevalence, subthreshold affects another ~2% [@Merikangas2007-hu](Merikangas2007-hu)
- Subtypes
  + **Bipolar I**: manic episodes, possible depressive ones
  + **Bipolar II**: no manic episodes but hypomania (disinhibition, irritability/agitation) + depression

## Background on BPD

- Psychosis (hallucinations or delusions)
- Anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
- Substance abuse

## (Neuro)biology of BPD

>From a neurobiological perspective there is no such thing as bipolar disorder. Rather, it is almost certainly the case that many somewhat similar, but subtly different, pathological conditions produce a disease state that we currently diagnose as bipolarity...

-- @Maletic2014-oe

---

>This heterogeneity – reflected in the lack of synergy between our current diagnostic schema and our rapidly advancing scientific understanding of the condition – limits attempts to articulate an integrated perspective on bipolar disorder.

-- @Maletic2014-oe

## Therapies for bipolar disorder

- Psychotherapy
- Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)
- Sleep medications
- Drugs

## Drugs

- Anti-depressants not especially effective [@Sidor2012-ki; @Gitlin2018-uu]
  - May destablize mood
- Anticonvulsants
    + Typically used to treat epilepsy
    + Usually GABA-A receptor agonists
    + e.g. [lamotrigine](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a695007.html) (Lamictal)
- Atypical antipsychotics

## Drugs

- Mood stabilizers
  + [Valproate](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682412.html) (Depakote)
  + Lithium (Li)

## Lithium (Li)

## Li effects [@malhi_potential_2013]

- Reduces mania, minimal effects on depressive states
- Preserves prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, amygdala volumes
- downregulates DA, glutamate; upregulates GABA
- **levels can be tested/monitored via blood test**

## [Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD)](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-research/practical/step-bd) cohort 

- $n=1,469$
+ 58% achieved recovery
+ 49% (of recovered) had recurrences within 2 years
+ Residual depressive symptoms can persist

## Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes ([BSNIP Project](http://b-snip.org/))

>Bipolar and schizophrenia network for intermediate phenotypes is a network of investigator-driven laboratories focused on developing phenotypes, genotypes, and biomarkers for psychosis. Over the last 5 years, the consortium has accomplished a dense phenotyping protocol using probands with a lifetime history of psychosis, their relatives, and healthy controls. 

---

>This has established a library of biomarker information on individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychosis. The founding goal of establishing disease biomarkers for current psychotic diagnoses has been poorly met, because the cognitive, electrophysiologic, eye movement, and brain imaging biomarkers did not regularly discriminate individuals with different DSM psychosis diagnoses. 

-- [BSNIP Project](http://b-snip.org/)

---

>In (the) future, we will use this biomarker information to establish a pathway to biomarker-based classification in psychoses.

- Genetic + environmental risk
- Changes in emotion processing network activity, size of hippocampus
- Heterogeneous

## Disruptions heterogenous

>Compared to the healthy comparison group, the schizophrenia group showed widespread reductions in FA and CT, involving virtually all white matter tracts and cortical regions. Paradoxically, however, no more than 15–20% of patients deviated from the normative range for any single tract or region...Thus, while infra-normal deviations were common among patients, their anatomical loci were highly inconsistent between individuals.

## Disconnectivity in cortical networks

- But connectivity findings inconsistent [@Fornito2015-go](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2014.08.006)
- **Reduced structural** connectivity vs.
    - Synaptic, dendritic, axonal connections b/w regions
    - Usually measured via DTI or related diffusion-based MRI technique
- **Increased functional** connectivity
    - BOLD, EEG, or MEG covariance
    - Task-free 'resting' state or task-based

![@Fornito2015-go. Figure 1. De-coupling of network structure and function in schizophrenia.

>Interestingly, at present most modalities perform similarly in the classification of psychosis, with slight advantages for rs-FC relative to structural modalities in some specific cases. Notably, results differed substantially across studies, with suggestions of biased effect sizes, particularly highlighting the need for more studies using external prediction and large sample sizes. @Porter2023-qt

## Neurochemical factors

## Dopamine (DA) hypothesis

![](../include/img/mesolimbocortical-da.jpg){width=75%}

## Evidence for...

- DA ($D_2$ receptor) antagonists (e.g. chlorpromazine)
    + improve positive symptoms
- *Typical antipsychotics* are DA $D_2$ receptor antagonists
- DA agonists (amphetamine, cocaine, L-DOPA)
  + mimic or exacerbate symptoms
    
## Evidence against...

- New, *atypical antipsychotics* 
    + (e.g. Clozapine) INCREASE DA in frontal cortex, affect 5-HT
- Mixed evidence for high DA metabolite levels in CSF
- Some DA neurons may release 5-HT, cannabinoids, glutamate [@Seutin2005-wx](https://doi.org/https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjp.0706328)

## Glutamate/ketamine hypothesis

- *Psychomimetic* drugs can induce schizophrenia-like states
    + Phencyclidine (PCP), ketamine
    + NMDA-R (receptor) antagonists
- Ketamine
  - dissociative (secondary) anesthetic
  - side effects include hallucinations, blurred vision, delirium, floating sensations, vivid dreams
  - binds to serotonin ($5HT_{2a}$) receptor, opioid receptors
  - may be dopamine $D_2$ receptor antagonist
  
## Glutamate/ketamine hypothesis

- Schizophrenia $\rightarrow$ *underactivation* of NMDA receptors?
  - NMDA-R role in learning, plasticity
- NMDA-R antagonists -> neurodegeneration, excitotoxicity, & apoptosis
- DA dysfunction in striatum coupled to cortical Glu + GABA levels
- Cortical disinhibition of striatum

---

>The data show that the disorder is characterized by lower levels of glutamate, GABA and dopamine in the frontal cortex, and potentially other cortical regions; higher levels of glutamate in the basal ganglia and thalamus; and greater dopamine synthesis and release capacity in the basal ganglia relative to healthy individuals. Moreover, connections among some of these alterations indicate a key role for fronto-thalamo-striatal–midbrain circuits in the pathophysiology of the disorder. 

--- @Howes2023-vk

## Developmental origins

## Rapid gray matter loss in adolescents?

![@thompson_mapping_2001](../include/img/thompson-2001-F2.large.jpg)

## Early life stress

- 2x greater odds for children in urban environments
- Higher risk among migrant populations, @Cantor-Graae2005-ej
- Exposure to infection *in utero*, other birth complications
- Exposure to cannibis
- Paternal age > 40

## Early life stress

- @levine_transgenerational_2016
  - Children (N=51,233) of parents who born during Nazi era (1922-1945)
  - Emigrated before (indirect exposure) or after (direct exposure) to Nazi era
  - Children exposed to direct stress of Nazi era *in utero* or postnatally
      + Did **not** differ in rates of schizophrenia, but
      + Had higher re-hospitalization rates
      
## Early life stress

- Danish cohort (*n*=1,141,447), @debost_investigating_2015
  - Exposure to early life stress 
    + *in utero* did **not** increase risk of schizophrenia, but
    + stress during 0-2 years increased risk
  - Increased risk associated with cortisol-related gene

## Summing up

- Wide-ranging disturbance of mood, thought, action, perception
- Broad changes in brain structure, function, chemistry, development
- (Simplistic) dopamine hypothesis giving way to signalling network (DA + Glu + GABA) models
- Genetic (polygenic = multiple genes) risk + environmental factors

### Biomarkers

![Table 1 from @Kraguljac2021-kp](../include/img/kraguljac-2021-tbl01.png)

### Novel therapies

- Virtual Reality Assisted therapy [@Bisso2020-nq; @Dellazizzo2021-tk]

>Short-term findings showed that both interventions produced significant improvements in AVH severity and depressive symptoms. Although results did not show a statistically significant superiority of VRT over CBT for AVH, VRT did achieve larger effects particularly on overall AVH (d = 1.080 for VRT and d = 0.555 for CBT). Furthermore, results suggested a superiority of VRT over CBT on affective symptoms. VRT also showed significant results on persecutory beliefs and quality of life. Effects were maintained up to the 1-year follow-up. VRT highlights the future of patient-tailored approaches that may show benefits over generic CBT for voices. A fully powered single-blind randomized controlled trial comparing VRT to CBT is underway. [@Dellazizzo2021-tk]

![Figure 1 from @Tamminga2014-gn. Multiple illustrative data from bipolar and schizophrenia network for intermediate phenotyping (BSNIP) study. (a) Social function quantified with the Birchwood Social Function Scale in the BSNIP sample. Details in reference 13. Schizophrenia (SZ) and schizoaffective disorder (SAD) groups were almost identical, while bipolar disorder (BDP) showed slightly higher scores. Relatives of all groups were modestly impaired. The patterns of impairment were similar across diagnostic groups. (b) The Schizo-Bipolar scale was developed from the SCID diagnostic criteria for these psychotic diagnoses.12 There was almost continuous overlap between these diagnoses with no point of rarity over this spectrum, lacking support for distinct illness groups based on phenomenology. (c) Cognition was measured with the BACS.14 Group scores are depicted for the diagnostic subgroups, showing the greatest impairment in the SZ group and the least in the BDP group with SAD in between, separated by severity; however groups did not show distinctive qualitative cognitive alterations from each other, except for the severity. (d) In the evoked potential auditory oddball paradigm, the patient groups (SZ and BDP) resembled each other rather broadly, with minimal, distinctive differences, discussed in reference 15. (e) The antisaccade error rates were increased in all patient groups, highest in SZ and lower in BDP, without any differences across relatives.16 Again, while severity differences were present, no other distinctions existed across diagnostic groups. (f) Differences between SZ and BPP groups are present after a pair auditory stimulus, including differences in both patient groups in baseline levels, especially before S2.17 (g) Using VBM analysis to determine grey matter volume,21 a distinctive difference between SZ/SAD, on the one hand and BDP on the other, emerged; specifically, SA and SAD groups demonstrated significant and widespread grey matter volume reduction, while the BDP showed very little grey matter reduction in any area. This would represent a difference between diagnostic groups of a qualitative as well as quantitative nature. (h) FreeSurfer showed a similar outcome, with grey matter reductions widespread in all cortical regions in SZ and SAD, while no distinctive reductions in BDP. (i). Resting state fMRI analysis shows a number of distinctive cerebral networks based on ICA, that were distinctive in some or all of the diagnostic groups.18 In general, these networks were different between all probands and all healthy controls.](../include/img/tamminga-etal-2014-fig-1.png)
