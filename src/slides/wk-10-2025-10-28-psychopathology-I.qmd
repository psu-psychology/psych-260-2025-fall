## Neuroscience of mental illness

- Diagnosis via behavior & mood, not specific "biomarker"
- Presume diseases of the mind are disorders of the brain
  - System-wide effects; no single or simple cause
    
## Neuroscience of mental illness

- Heritability
  + *proportion of variance in trait accounted for by genetic factors*
  - Higher for psychiatric disorders than non-psychiatric diseases
  - Family member with mental illness highest known risk factor
- ~50% of patients do not respond to anti-depressant medication

# Major depressive disorder

## Major Depressive Disorder

- Symptoms
    + Unhappy mood, insomnia, lethargy, loss of pleasure, interest, energy
- Agitation
- Lasting for several weeks or more

![Table 1 from @mahar_stress_2014](../include/img/mahar-table-1.jpg)

## Major Depressive Disorder

- Experienced by ~7% Americans in any year
- Prevalence (up to ~20% lifetime)
    - Females 2-3x males
    
## Major Depressive Disorder

- Heritability (large, 2.5 M Swedish population study)
    - Females 0.49 (twins); 0.51 (non-twin relatives)
    - Males 0.41 (twins); 0.36 (non-twin relatives)

>MDD is a complex disorder that cannot be fully explained by any one single established biological or environmental pathway. Instead, MDD seems to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, psychological and biological factors. 

-- @Marx2023-ks

## Neurobiology of

- Reduced sizes of brain regions
- Altered brain activity
- Neurotrophic factors
- Neurotransmitters
- Hormones (corticosteroid)

## Neural substrates [@Price2012-lk]

## Disrupted connectivity

- Resting state fMRI (rsFMRI) in $n=421$ patients with major depressive disorder and $n=488$ control subjects.
- *Reduced* connectivity between orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and other areas of the brain
- *Increased* connectivity between lateral PFC and other brain areas

```

## Hormonal factors

- Endocrine
    + Thyroid dysfunction [@Medici2014-pn](http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/jc.2013-3589)
    + Altered cortisol reactivity [@Burke2005-ya](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.02.010)
    
## Neurotransmitters

- Monoamine hypothesis
    + More: euphoria
    + Less: depression
    + Reserpine (antagonist for NE & 5-HT) can cause depression
    + Low serotonin (5-HT) metabolite levels in CSF of suicidal depressives [@samuelsson_csf_2006](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00639.x)

## Measuring serotonin (5-HT)
    
- CSF, platelets, plasma, urine, saliva
- CSF & platelets correlate highly [@Audhya2012-sv](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.05.012)
- But, salivary 5-HT does not correlate with mood symptoms [@Leung2018-ks](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgmr.2018.03.008)

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Table 2 from [@Palazidou2012-je](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bmb/lds004)"}
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/palazido-2012-table-2.jpg")
```

## Treatments for depression

- Psychotherapy
    + Often effective when combined with drug treatment
- Exercise
- Drugs

## Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors

+ MAO destroys excess monoamines in terminal buttons & glia
+ MAO-Iâ€™s boost monoamine levels
      
## Tricyclics

+ Inhibit NE, 5-HT reuptake
+ Upregulate monoamine levels, but non-selective => side effects
    
## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

+ Fluoxetine (Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft)
+ Prolong duration of 5-HT in synaptic cleft
  + Also increase brain steroid production
- Selective Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Cymbalta commercial from [@Pries2009-ka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTZvnAF7UsA)"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTZvnAF7UsA", height = "600px")
```

## How well do the drugs work?

- [STAR*D trial](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-research/practical/stard/allmedicationlevels.shtml)
- On SSRI for 12-14 weeks. ~1/3 achieved remission; 10-15% showed symptom reduction.
- If SSRI didn't work, could switch drugs. ~25% became symptom free.
- 16% of participants dropped out due to tolerability issues
- 6-7 weeks to show response

## Who benefits from drug therapy?

- Depends on
    + Early life stress (ELS)
    + Brain (amygdala) response to emotional faces
- [@goldstein-piekarski_human_2016](http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1606671113)
    - Low ELS + low amyg reactivity > responding
    - High ELS + high amyg reactivity > responding

```

## Monoamine hypothesis of depression

- Disrupted (lowered) levels of monoamines (especially NE & 5-HT) result in depression
- Problems with monoamine hypothesis
    - Too simplistic
    - Monoamines interact
    - Drugs fast acting (min), but improvement slow (weeks)

- What do drugs do, then?
    - Alter receptor sensitivity?
        + 5-HT presynaptic autoreceptors compensate
        + Postsynaptic upregulation of NE/5-HT effects
    - Stimulate neurogenesis?
        + Link to neurotrophin, brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF)
        + BDNF boosts neurogenesis
        + SSRIs stimulate growth of new neurons in hippocampus
    - Neurogenesis hypothesis, [@mahar_stress_2014](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.11.009)
        - Chronic stress causes neural loss in hipp
        - Chronic stress downregulates 5-HT sensitivity
        - Depression ~ chronic stress
        - Anti-depressants upregulate neurogenesis via 5-HT modulation
        
>"*The serotonin hypothesis of depression is still influential. We aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on whether depression is associated with lowered serotonin concentration or activity in a systematic umbrella review of the principal relevant areas of research. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched using terms appropriate to each area of research, from their inception until December 2020. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large data-set analyses in the following areas were identified: serotonin and serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, concentrations in body fluids; serotonin 5-HT1A receptor binding; serotonin transporter (SERT) levels measured by imaging or at post-mortem; tryptophan depletion studies; SERT gene associations and SERT gene-environment interactions...**The main areas of serotonin research provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations.***"

## New horizons...

## Ketamine

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="From [Washington Post, 2019-03-06](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/03/06/biggest-advance-depression-years-fda-approves-novel-treatment-hardest-cases/)" }
knitr::include_graphics("include/img/ketamine.jpg")
```

- Ketamine is a selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor 
- Relieves depressive symptoms relatively quickly [@Berman2000-vg](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10686270) and [@Zarate2006-np](http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.63.8.856)
- Boosts synaptic spine formation [@Li2010-ve](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1190287) and reverses effects of induced stress

## Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)

- Last line of treatment for drug-resistant depression
- Electric current delivered to the brain causes 30-60s seizure.
- ECT usually done in a hospital's operating or recovery room  under general anesthesia
- Once every 2 - 5 days for a total of 6 - 12 sessions.
- Remission rates of up to 50.9% [@dierckx_efficacy_2012](http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-5618.2012.00997.x)
- Seems to work via
    + Anticonvulsant (block Na+ channel or enhance GABA function) effects
    + Neurotrophic (stimulates neurogenesis) effects

- ECT more effective than Ketamine? [@Ekstrand2021-cq](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ijnp/pyab088)

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Figure 3 from [@Ekstrand2021-cq](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ijnp/pyab088)"}

```

## Deep brain stimulation

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.cap="From [ucsf2021-db](https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCY8uQr2LKo)"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCY8uQr2LKo", height="600px")
```

## Depression's impact

- Widespread brain dysfunction
- Prefrontal cortex, amygdala, HPA axis, circadian rhythms
- Genetic + environmental factors
- Disturbance in 5-HT, NE systems, cortisol
- Metabolic pathways [@Pu2020-pb](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-0645-4)
- Many sufferers do not respond to available treatments
- Drug treatments affect neuromodulator NT systems, but
    - Can't effectively measure NT levels
    - Neuromodulators interact, so many side-effects
- 'Monoamine hypothesis' of depression is at-best incomplete
- 'Talk' therapies can change behavior/mood by creating new/strengthened circuits in other areas
- Emerging therapies (ketamine, deep brain stimulation) show promise, but...

> "*Leading biological hypotheses propose that biological changes may underlie major depressive disorder onset and relapse/recurrence. Here, we investigate if there is prospective evidence for biomarkers derived from leading theories. We focus on neuroimaging, gastrointestinal factors, immunology, neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, and oxidative stress....Our search resulted in 67,464 articles...Only cortisol (N=19, OR=1.294, p=0.024) showed a predictive effect on onset/relapse/recurrence of MDD, but not on time until MDD onset/relapse/recurrence. However, this effect disappeared when studies including participants with a baseline clinical diagnosis were removed from the analyses...there is a lack of evidence for leading biological theories for onset and maintenance of depression. Only cortisol was identified as potential predictor for MDD, but results are influenced by the disease state. High-quality (prospective) studies on MDD are needed to disentangle the etiology and maintenance of MDD.*"
