>MDD is a complex disorder that cannot be fully explained by any one single established biological or environmental pathway. Instead, MDD seems to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, psychological and biological factors.

# Causes & effects

## Pathogenesis {.scrollable}

## MDD Heritability

- Large, 2.5 M Swedish population study, @Kendler2018-cl
  - Females 0.49 (twins); 0.51 (non-twin relatives)
  - Males 0.41 (twins); 0.36 (non-twin relatives)
- ~35% [@Geschwind2015-xm; @Otte2016-rp]

## Monoamine hypothesis

- Or "chemical imbalance theory"
+ More: euphoria
+ Less: depression

## Monoamine hypothesis

- Reserpine [@Wikipedia-contributors2025-ov]
  - reduces blood pressure
  - NE antagonist
  - Early (1950s-60s) use as anti-psychotic drug to treat schizophrenia
  - Once thought to induce depressive symptoms, but see [@Baumeister2003-cw]

# Treatments

## Drugs

- Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (MAOIs)
- Tricyclics
- Selective (Serotonin/Serotonin-Norephinephrine) Reuptake Inhibitors

## Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors

+ MAO degrade monoamines in synaptic cleft (chemical inactivation)
+ MAOI’s boost monoamine levels
- Used to treat MDD, panic disorder, anxiety disorder
- But side effects, especially high blood pressure
      
## Tricyclics

- Named for atomic structure
+ Inhibit NE, 5-HT reuptake -> Upregulate monoamine levels
- Used to treat MDD, anxiety
- Non-selective -> side effects

## Tricyclics

>The long-term effects of tricyclic antidepressants and the effects on quality of life are unknown. Short-term results suggest that tricyclic antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms while also increasing the risks of serious adverse events, but these results were based on low and very low certainty evidence.

-- @Kamp2024-mz
    
## Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

+ Fluoxetine (Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft)
+ Prolong duration of 5-HT in synaptic cleft
  + Increase brain steroid production
- Selective Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)
  - Inhibit both 5-HT and NE transporters

## Cymbalta an SNRI

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTZvnAF7UsA width="100%" height="70%" >}}

## How well do the drugs work?

- [STAR*D trial](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-research/practical/stard/allmedicationlevels.shtml)
- $35M NIMH-funded clinical trial 2001-2007, target *n*=4,000

## STAR*D protocol

- On SSRI for 12-14 weeks.
- If SSRI didn't work, could switch drugs up to 3 times

## STAR*D results

- 1st round
  - ~1/3 achieved remission; 10-15% showed symptom reduction
- 2nd round
  - ~25% became symptom free.
- 67% cumulative remission rate
- 6-7 weeks to show response

## STAR*D reanalyzed 

- @Pigott2023-xv
- STAR*D investigators deviated from their own protocol (raters were not blind to status)
- Included data that should have been excluded

>In contrast to the STAR*D-reported 67% cumulative remission rate after up to four antidepressant treatment trials, the rate was 35.0% when using the protocol-stipulated HRSD and inclusion in data analysis criteria

## Monoamine hypothesis reconsidered

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- Too simplistic
- Monoamines interact 
- Drugs fast acting (min), but improvement slow (weeks)

>No correlation between serotonin and its metabolite 5-HIAA in the cerebrospinal fluid and [11C]AZ10419369 binding measured with PET in healthy volunteers.

-- @Tiger2015-dy

>...we performed the first meta-analysis of the mood effects in [acute tryptophan depletion] ATD and [alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine] APTD studies. The depletion of monoamine systems (both 5-HT and NE/DA) does not decrease mood in healthy controls. However, in healthy controls with a family history of MDD the results suggest that mood is slightly decreased...by [monoamine depletion]...

>"*The serotonin hypothesis of depression is still influential. We aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on whether depression is associated with lowered serotonin concentration or activity in a systematic umbrella review of the principal relevant areas of research. 

-- @Moncrieff2022-os

---

>The main areas of serotonin research provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations.

-- @Moncrieff2022-os

## When drugs *do* work, how?

- Alter receptor sensitivity?
  - 5-HT terminals contain autoreceptors
  - Presynaptic autoreceptors regulate 5-HT release
  - Autoreceptors compensate for elevated 5-HT from SSRIs 
  + Postsynaptic receptor upregulation of NE/5-HT effects?

## When drugs do work, how?

- Stimulate neurogenesis?
  + Link to neurotrophin, brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF)
  + BDNF boosts neurogenesis

## Neurogenesis hypothesis 

- @mahar_stress_2014
- Chronic stress causes neural loss in hippocampus
  - Cortisol and CRF receptors in hippocampus
- Chronic stress down-regulates 5-HT sensitivity

## Neurogenesis hypothesis

- Depression ~ chronic stress
- Anti-depressants upregulate neurogenesis via 5-HT modulation
- Hippocampus one site where neurogenesis occurs in adults

## Other approaches

- Psychotherapy
- Other drugs
- Neurostimulation

## Psychotherapy

- Effective in treating MDD
- No clear differences among therapy types
- Similar outcomes as antidepressant medication
- @Otte2016-rp

## Ketamine

- Selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor
  - NMDA is an ionotropic glutamate (Glu) receptor
- Relieves depressive symptoms relatively quickly [@Berman2000-vg; @Zarate2006-np]
- But only for a short time
- Boosts synaptic spine formation [@Li2010-ve] and reverses effects of induced stress

## Ketamine

>Our findings show that ketamine and esketamine may be more efficacious than placebo at 24 hours. How these findings translate into clinical practice, however, is not entirely clear...Long term non‐inferiority RCTs comparing repeated ketamine and esketamine, and rigorous real‐world monitoring are needed to establish comprehensive data on safety and efficacy.

-- @Dean2021-qw

## Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)

- Last line of treatment for drug-resistant depression
- Electric current delivered to the brain causes 30-60s seizure
- Usually done in a hospital's operating or recovery room under general anesthesia

## Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)

- Once every 2-5 days for a total of 6-12 sessions.
- Remission rates of up to 50.9% [@dierckx_efficacy_2012]
- Seems to work via
  + Intrinsic anticonvulsant effects (brain responds to seizure with seizure-preventing responses)
  + Neurotrophic (stimulates neurogenesis) effects

# Wrap-up

## Main points

- MDD highly prevalent
- MDD widespread dysfunction
- No universal biomarkers, but high heritability

## Main points

- Weak evidence for "chemical imbalance"
- Monoamine drugs widely prescribed, work sometimes in some people
- Weak evidence for monoamine hypothesis
- How reuptake inhibitors alleviate MDD not clear

## Main points  

- Some evidence for altered HPA system, especially cortisol
- MDD may mimic chronic stress & affect neural development
- Ketamine faster acting than monoamine-affecting drugs

## Main points

- Psychotherapy can be effective
- ECT, deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression

>...High-quality (prospective) studies on MDD are needed to disentangle the etiology and maintenance of MDD.
