## Today's topics {-}

- Warm up
- History of neuroscience
- Levels of analysis
- Neuroscience methods

# Warm-up {-}

## Neuroscience is harder than physics because...{-}

::: {.incremental}
- A. The brain has more parts than any other physical entity we know about.
- B. Physicists have largely ignored biology.
- C. Nervous systems are influenced by multiple factors we can't (yet) measure effectively.
- D. Physics involves lots of math; you can't study the mind with math.

## Take homes

- History of neuroscience -> 
  - history of *methods* for observing & measuring
  - history of *ideas* about what observations mean
- Neurological bases of human behavior involve
  - Mutliple spatial scales (small to large)
  - Multiple temporal scales (small to large)
